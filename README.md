# CoCo-MakeCoCo
A simple BASH script to build CoCo assembly programs and place them on DSK files.

At the time of this shell scripts creation it utilized LW-TOOLS 4.17 for
assembly of the program and TOOLSHED 2.2 for CoCo DSK file creation. This
script assumes you have placed the needed programs in to the environment
path for running. Modify the setup variables as needed for your own use.

NOTE: This does not include a launcher for any virtual environments. Feel
free to add that if you desire. I like reviewing things before firing off
VCC or something to test right away. Double checking things never hurts.
